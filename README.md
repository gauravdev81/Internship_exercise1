# Internship-Exercise-1
  **Calculator:**
This is a simple calculator program written in python which calculates the addition,subtraction, multiplication and division of two integers.

# User Story:
As a user, I want to be able to add,subtract,multiply and divide two binary numbers.
# Test Cases:
***Test Case 01 [Summation]***:

&emsp;**Input**: "5 10"
&emsp;**Expected Result**: 15 (since 5+10 = 15 )

***Test Case 02 [Subtraction]***:
 
&emsp;**Input**:  "7 3" 
&emsp;**Expected Result**: 4 (since 7-3 = 4 )

***Test Case 03 [Multiplication]***:
 
&emsp;**Input**: "3 2"
&emsp;**Expected Result**:  6 (since 3*2 = 6)

***Test Case 04 [Division]***:

&emsp;**Input**: "10 5" 

&emsp;**Expected Result**: 2  (since 10/5=2)
